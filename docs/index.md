# OpenScope Docs Index

## Purpose

This `docs/` tree is the durable memory and routing surface for `OpenScope`.

- start here before making workflow, requirement, design, or implementation changes
- prefer the smallest file that answers the current question
- keep durable conclusions in files, not only in chat

## Routing Authority

This file is the top-level docs router.

- `docs/index.md` owns navigation and directory responsibilities
- `AGENTS.md` owns agent workflow rules and execution expectations
- `docs/design/` and `docs/architecture/` own the stable project attractor

## Recommended Default Path

For most small and medium projects, the default path is:

1. `docs/context/`
2. `docs/backlog/` when choosing work
3. `docs/input/`
4. `docs/requirements/`
5. `docs/design/` and `docs/architecture/`
6. route the task and select candidate reusable skills
7. `docs/plans/` when planning triggers apply
8. `docs/audits/` for audit workflow guidance or stored non-trivial audit records
9. `docs/logs/`
10. `docs/bugs/` when needed

Use `docs/discussions/`, extra `docs/testing/` notes, `docs/skills/`, `docs/analysis/`, and `docs/retrospectives/` only when the task complexity or ambiguity justifies them.

## Skill Routing

| If the task is...                       | Read this first                                       | Then decide                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unclear requirement                     | `docs/requirements/00-requirement-synthesis-guide.md` | whether a requirement file or discussion file is needed first                                             |
| non-trivial implementation              | `AGENTS.md`                                           | which skills are needed per phase or item, then use `docs/plans/00-plan-authoring-and-execution-guide.md` |
| document, plan, or closure verification | `docs/skills/README.md`                               | which audit prompt or review skill applies                                                                |
| repeated known method or review pattern | the relevant owner doc                                | whether an existing skill applies or a new one should be created                                          |

Skills select the work method. They do not replace requirements, design, architecture, or owner-doc routing.

## Domain Quick-Reference (Optional)

本项目单域（可观测性发行版），无多域路由需求，此段按模板指引移除。变更路由见 `docs/context/codebase-map.md` Common Change Routes。

## Directory Roles

- `docs/process/` - workflow and operating process documents
- `docs/context/` - mandatory AI context, owner precedence, and project-wide conventions
- `docs/backlog/` - prioritized candidate work, AI-ready next actions, and an optional roadmap when milestone-level progress is needed
- `docs/input/` - raw external inputs and copied source material
- `docs/discussions/` - optional requirement clarification and unresolved question records
- `docs/requirements/` - synthesized implementation-ready requirement docs
- `docs/design/` - stable app-layer feature and business-flow owner docs
- `docs/architecture/` - stable technical baseline and module-boundary docs
- `docs/lessons/` - durable engineering lessons extracted from repeated issues and recoveries
- `docs/references/` - stable lookup guides and maintenance aids
- `docs/articles/` - outward-facing methodology and explanatory articles
- `docs/examples/` - small copyable skeletons for dated working documents
- `docs/plans/` - execution plans with closure criteria
- `docs/audits/` - audit methods and optional stored audit records
- `docs/skills/` - optional reusable AI prompts and audit/review playbooks
- `docs/logs/` - dated implementation memory
- `docs/testing/` - optional exploratory and manual testing notes
- `docs/bugs/` - complex regression history and root-cause notes
- `docs/analysis/` - optional investigations, comparisons, and design tradeoffs
- `docs/retrospectives/` - optional post-delivery gap analysis and process improvements
- `docs/archive/` - inactive documents moved here by human decision; kept for historical reference

## Core Principle

Use files for durable truth.

- input captures where requirements came from
- context captures mandatory project rules and source-of-truth precedence
- backlog captures prioritized next actions and autonomy labels
- discussions capture what was unclear
- requirements capture what should be built
- design and architecture capture what must stay true
- source-of-truth precedence tells which artifact wins for each question
- plans capture how a non-trivial slice will be closed
- audits capture how claims were challenged
- logs, tests, and bug notes preserve proof and memory
- retrospectives explain why the last iteration still missed the mark

## Naming Rule

- stable owner docs keep stable names
- time-sensitive records should usually include dates
- see `docs/references/document-naming-and-timeliness.md`
