# AGENTS.md

## Project Intent

`OpenScope` uses a lightweight Attractor-Guided Engineering workflow for AI-assisted application development.

This repository is for an application-layer product, not a framework-core project.

The repo is the source of truth. Chat is only a temporary working surface.

Before writing non-trivial code, agents must first understand:

- `docs/context/project-context.md`
- `docs/context/ai-autonomy-policy.md`
- `docs/context/codebase-map.md`
- the requirement or owner doc (under `docs/requirements/` or `docs/design/`) that describes the work's intended behavior — current work-in-progress is read from unfinished plans in `docs/plans/`, not from a field in `project-context.md`
- the relevant raw inputs under `docs/input/` when requirement meaning depends on source material

Read `docs/context/source-of-truth-and-precedence.md` when facts conflict or you are unsure which artifact owns the answer.
Read `docs/process/application-development-workflow.md` when planning or workflow decisions are part of the task.

## Task Routing

Before writing code, agents MUST classify the task first:

1. Determine the task type:
   - requirement clarification
   - app-layer design change
   - architecture change
   - implementation-only change
   - bug investigation
   - verification or audit work
2. Use `docs/index.md` to read the owner docs for that task type before acting.
3. Check `docs/skills/README.md` for candidate reusable skills before drafting or revising a plan.
4. For non-trivial work, record the chosen route and planned skill usage in the plan before implementation.

Do not jump from a feature request directly to code unless the route is already obvious from the active requirement and owner docs.

## Operating Rules

1. Prefer file-in, file-out collaboration.
2. Do not treat chat summaries as durable project memory.
3. Do not jump from raw PM text or prototype screenshots straight to code when scope is still unclear.
4. If input is ambiguous, first create or update a file in `docs/discussions/` or `docs/requirements/`.
5. Create or update a plan before implementation when the planning triggers below apply.
6. Keep `docs/design/` and `docs/architecture/` focused on the current supported baseline, not migration history.
7. Keep logs short, dated, and append-only. After completing any significant code change, you MUST update the daily dev log at `docs/logs/{year}/{month}-{day}.md` (reverse chronological, see `docs/logs/00-log-writing-guide.md` for format).
8. Record non-obvious regressions in `docs/bugs/`.
9. If prototype and implementation diverge materially, capture the reason in `docs/retrospectives/` instead of silently moving on.
10. Promote repeated process lessons into `docs/skills/` or `docs/audits/` only when the pattern is recurring enough to justify reuse.
11. When creating, revising, executing, or auditing a file under `docs/plans/`, read `docs/plans/00-plan-authoring-and-execution-guide.md` first and follow it as the controlling workflow.
12. Keep code comments minimal. Prefer self-explanatory code; add only rare comments when a local constraint is otherwise easy to misread.
13. When a referenced file is not found at its expected path, check `docs/archive/` before concluding it does not exist. Archived files retain their original relative name under `docs/archive/`. Do not move files to `docs/archive/` without human approval.
14. Treat reusable skills as method selectors, not substitutes for requirements, design, or architecture docs. Business knowledge belongs in owner docs first.
15. When the same error pattern keeps recurring, do not stop at prose-only lessons. First promote it into a reusable audit prompt, checklist, or review playbook when that method is still missing. If the defect pattern still recurs, then evaluate promotion into a heuristic script, static check, lint rule, CI guard, or codemod, tuned to the copied project's real conventions and false-positive tolerance.

## Read This First

- `docs/context/project-context.md`
- `docs/context/ai-autonomy-policy.md`
- `docs/context/codebase-map.md`
- the active requirement listed in `docs/context/project-context.md`
- the active owner doc listed in `docs/context/project-context.md`

Read additionally when needed:

- `docs/context/source-of-truth-and-precedence.md` for ownership or conflict questions
- `docs/context/conventions.md` for project-wide conventions
- `docs/process/application-development-workflow.md` for workflow questions
- `docs/index.md` when you need routing beyond the active files

## Documentation Ownership

- `docs/context/` owns mandatory AI context, source-of-truth precedence, and project-wide conventions.
- `docs/backlog/` owns prioritized candidate work and AI-ready next actions.
- `docs/input/` owns raw external inputs such as PM notes, card docs, article extracts, prototype references, and copied source material.
- `docs/discussions/` owns requirement clarification conversations and unresolved question records.
- `docs/requirements/` owns implementation-ready requirement synthesis.
- `docs/design/` owns stable app-layer business and feature design.
- `docs/architecture/` owns cross-cutting technical and module-boundary truth.
- `docs/lessons/` owns durable reusable lessons extracted from bugs, audits, and retrospectives.
- `docs/plans/` owns execution and closure criteria for non-trivial work.
- `docs/audits/` owns audit workflow records and audit methodology.
- `docs/skills/` owns reusable prompts, review playbooks, and audit prompt templates.
- `docs/logs/` owns dated implementation memory.
- `docs/testing/` owns manual and exploratory testing records.
- `docs/bugs/` owns non-obvious bug histories and regression notes.
- `docs/analysis/` owns research, tradeoff analysis, and rejected directions.
- `docs/retrospectives/` owns post-implementation gap analysis and process improvements.

## Default Workflow

1. Gather raw materials in `docs/input/`.
2. If needed, clarify ambiguity in `docs/discussions/`.
3. Synthesize implementation-ready requirements in `docs/requirements/`.
4. Split stable design output into app-layer design under `docs/design/` and technical design under `docs/architecture/`, with the two referencing each other when needed.
5. Route the task and select candidate reusable skills.
6. Write or update a plan when the planning triggers apply, and record skill usage per phase or item when relevant.
7. Audit the plan before implementation.
8. Implement the smallest complete slice.
9. Run verification.
10. Run closure audit for created plans.
11. Record logs and any needed bug notes.

## Optional Workflow Layers

Use these when warranted by task complexity. Plan and closure audits are mandatory for created plans.

- `docs/audits/` for document audits and non-trivial stored audit records
- `docs/testing/` for manual or exploratory proof
- `docs/retrospectives/` for material requirement/prototype gaps
- `docs/skills/` for reusable prompts after repeated failures
- `docs/lessons/` for durable engineering lessons after repeated failures or important recoveries

Use `multi-dimensional-audit-prompt.md` when work must be challenged across several dimensions at once. Use `open-ended-audit-prompt.md` when the standard checklist may miss hidden risks. These prompts are generic defaults and MUST be customized after copy to match the project's real owner docs, protected areas, verification model, and recurring failure patterns.

## Planning Rule

Create a plan when the task has any of these traits:

- changes API, database/model, auth, integration, deployment, or public contract behavior
- changes user-visible behavior across more than one feature surface
- touches multiple modules and changes shared behavior
- is expected to take more than one AI session
- modifies more than 5 total files or is likely to exceed roughly 200 changed lines
- needs staged execution or explicit closure gates
- has unresolved product or technical risk that must not be hidden in chat

Skip a formal plan for low-risk edits: copy changes, small styling fixes, test-only cleanups, single-file behavior fixes with clear existing tests, AND small low-risk multi-file edits (roughly 1 to 3 non-generated files, about 200 changed lines or fewer) that touch no contract, data/model, auth, permission, integration, deployment, cross-surface behavior, documentation conflict, or unresolved product risk.

Even without a formal plan, do not mark work complete from chat memory alone. Verify the change against the actual diff and the real verification commands, then record a log entry. This cold-replay check applies to the no-plan path too.

### Reviewer-Availability Fallback

When no second reviewer or subagent is available, a solo cold-replay pass is acceptable ONLY for plans that are non-protected and non-high-risk. The plan MUST record that it used a solo review and note the limitation. Protected areas, unresolved product risk, and source-of-truth conflicts still require human or subagent review, or stay open.

All created plans MUST follow `docs/plans/00-plan-authoring-and-execution-guide.md` before implementation and closure. Protected areas, unresolved product risk, and source-of-truth conflicts require human/subagent review or stay open.

## Skill Usage Rule

Before using a reusable skill, confirm all of the following:

- the task type and route are already clear from the requirement and owner docs
- the skill matches the work method, not just a similar business label
- required inputs listed in `docs/skills/README.md` are available
- the expected output is known and can be stored in the correct docs location

For non-trivial plans, each phase or item that depends on a reusable skill should record `Skill: <name>` or `Skill: none`.

## Prompting Guidance For Agents

- Do not generate a full product from a single feature list.
- Do not optimize for demo completeness.
- Prefer small complete slices over broad placeholder coverage.
- Prefer existing project patterns over invented abstractions.
- If information is missing, write the missing assumptions into a requirement, discussion, or plan file instead of silently inventing them.
- Do not put code-level implementation detail into plan files unless the detail is required for scope or closure reasoning.
- Prefer citing the existing owner doc instead of restating the same rule in multiple files.
- Do not hide mandatory rules in `docs/references/`; if an AI must apply it by default, put it in `docs/context/` or `AGENTS.md`.
- Use `docs/backlog/` and `docs/context/ai-autonomy-policy.md` to decide whether AI may choose and execute the next task without asking.

## Docs Maintenance

After completing any significant code change, you MUST:

1. **Update the daily dev log** at `docs/logs/{year}/{month}-{day}.md` (reverse chronological, see `docs/logs/00-log-writing-guide.md` for format).
2. **Update relevant owner docs** in `docs/design/` or `docs/architecture/` when the change affects app-layer behavior or technical structure.

When verification passes completely (full green), record the verification status in the log entry and include it in the git commit message. This provides reliable known-good baselines for future debugging.

## Verification Baseline

Do not assume this template's example commands are valid for the copied project.

Use the real commands listed in `docs/context/project-context.md`.

If verification commands are blank or still placeholders, stop and fill them before reporting verification success.
